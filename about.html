  Hello and welcome! I'm Pavana, and this is a website for people like me, who can't cook. I created "Cook It Yourself" to provide quick and easy recipes for those who lack culinary skills. Now, I'm the type of person who can mess up making even the simplest foods, like waffles for example. I found these recipes that even I can't mess up! I hope you give them a try, and realize for yourself, that even you can create visually pleasing, delcious food!

  Now, let me tell you more about myself. I am a 15 year old sophmore at AIT.  I have 6 members in my family including myself. My mom, Thushara, is a computer engineer and my dad, Manoj, is an accountant. I have definitely acquired my passion for learning, as well as my persistence from my parents, which has helped me positively in all aspects of my life, including academics.  I also have 3 younger brother; Pranay, Tom, and Tarun. Pranay is in 7th grade, Tom is in 5th grade, and Tarun is in 2nd grade. I like to consider myself a passionate and dedicated person when I am to do something that interests me. For example, writing. I love to write. I mostly enjoy writing poetry, but sometimes short stories as well. Additionally, tennis is my favorite sport and I play for my home team (Roselle Park Panthers). I also enjoy watching movies, going shopping, and eating delicious food (and now cooking them too), and hanging out with my friends, in my free time. I consider myself to be an outgoing, intelligent, and honest person. So, that's a little insight on who I am.
